* READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AS FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE PART OF THE TEST*

We would like you to implement the page from the PSD. You will have to make decisions yourself how the responsive versions of the page will look.

The project has the following restrictions and requirements:
o You are not allowed to use any CSS framework or library [e.g. Bootstrap or reset.css]. This test is to test your CSS skills so all CSS code must be handwritten. You are allowed to use SASS/LESS as a preprocessor but then you need to include all files. Both the original and the resulting CSS files.
o You are not allowed to use JS frameworks and libraries.
o You must create 5, 7, 12 and 16 column and full width versions.

o Create the following parts
  o Menu
    o Logo
    o Menuitems
    o Searchbutton
  o Header
    o Full screenwidth image
    o "Onze visie" textblok
  o Textblok "TITEL OVER SROI/MVO"
  o Textblok "VERPRAAKSAAM"
  o "Ons Team"
    o Title and subtitle are text
    o Curved line on image is a filter.
  o Footer

o The fonts are Google fonts Lato and Neucha.

The project is judged on the following points in order of importance:
o The full width version is pixel-perfect by design from the PSD.
o The page is fully responsive.
o The project has been thoroughly tested on IE9, 10, 11; FF, Chrome, Safari latest version.
o There is good level of documentation in the code.
o The code is correct and clean.
o The code has been validated.
o The code is efficient.

The deadline is 8 hours after receiving (not reading) the e-mail. Naturally if you feel that you are done sooner then that's no problem. But being faster than the deadline is not a criteria. Quality of work is the most important thing. So please do not rush. If you have not finished in 8 hours then send us the result of your work anyway. Do not take more time! If you send in the test too late the work will not be considered! This is part of the test and very important.

You need to send the files back per e-mail in a zip file (without the design PSD) to oxana@nxte.nl. Do not put it on a server or repository (or Google Drive) where we have to download it. This is part of the test.

If there are any unclarities or problems then use your own best judgement to find a good solution. This test is also a test about your problem solving skills.

BONUS
You can get bonus points if you do the following point:
o The header on the homepage has a slider for both images and text. You are allowed to use JS frameworks and libraries for this.
