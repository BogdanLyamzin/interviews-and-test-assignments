# Front-End Challenge

Hey, let's build a simple blog.

We will start with a simple MVP. It will have Posts and Comments features.

## Functional Requirements

- The blog should have Latest Posts page (`/` route)
- The blog should have Post page (`/posts/:postId` route)
- The blog should have Create Post page (`/posts/new` route)
- User should be able to create a new post

## Technical Requirements

- Code should be written with TypeScript
- [ESLint and Prettier](https://dev.to/robertcoopercode/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project-53jb) setup for code linting
- We want to support SSR in our application. As the most simple solution, use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) because it supports SSR out of the box
- User interface should be built with [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- Make sure to use React hooks everywhere instead of class-based components
- Redux as data layer with any middlewares set you to prefer
- The project should have clear README with steps to run it
- Network request handled with [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- Use functional programming if you are know-how. [Ramda.js](http://ramdajs.com/) or [lodash/fp](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide) is plus to your score
- Deploy the app to any free hosting for review. This item is optional, but nice to have :)

## API

To persist data and work with real API, we're going to use simple Node.js API created in a few minutes. API hosted in the cloud and you can query it from anywhere. API endpoints documentation: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1917440/RzteTChV

## Design

The design is up to you. Simple, minimalistic and clean would be nice. As a general example check [Ghost standard UI](https://blog.ghost.org/).

## Conditions

- The code should be clean, passing ESLint checks and simple to understand
- Task usually takes **from 4 to 6 hours**. If you need more time, you're good to take it and it's appreciated, but results should be sent **no later than 48 hours after the start**
- Skills to write clean business logic evaluated higher than nice markup
- The challenge code should be pushed to **GitHub** repository. Send us a link to the repository right after that. Thanks!

If you have any questions about challenge details, ask for details, it's appreciated.

Have good luck and looking forward to work with you!
